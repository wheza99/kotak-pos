        Plasma is an open-source, local-first automation platform for people who
        value speed, precision, and autonomy. We believe automation should live
        where your work does — on your machine. That means no third-party
        servers, no forced integrations, and no silent failures. Whether
        you&apos;re scripting simple file routines or building multi-step,
        logic-heavy flows, Plasma puts you in the driver’s seat. Visual when it
        helps. Text-based when it matters.
        <br />
        <br />
        We believe good software should be scriptable, inspectable, and fully
        yours. That’s why Plasma is open source, privacy-respecting, and built
        to adapt to your needs—not the other way around.
